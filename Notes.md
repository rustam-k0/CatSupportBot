Notes for current project and future development:

* store every value with a Russian name, because users are Russians
* provide users with a link to the tables even if they do not add anything
* consider creating a second bot or second function - a bot for feedback (for users, not staff)
* consider adding fields (e.g. `bank` for income) - possibility for the future
* consider how to add a link to an image in the table
* consider storing all tables (Google Drive?)
* consider merging tables of separate animals into a single large CSV, where the animal name is in a column to separate actual transactions
* consider scaling to a more complex one if Sheets are not enough (e.g. PostgreSQL, more fields and variety, etc.)
* consider adding the possibility to easily switch to Russian-specific services (e.g. Yandex Browser & Yandex OCR)
* code should be very easy to follow, read, and edit
* consider that users will not have any technical knowledge
